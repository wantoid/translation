# Translation

## How can you help us?

1. Choose the language you want to contribute to (e.g. /it_IT)
2. Inside the folder you'll find two files you should download: `app.po` and `main.po`
3. You can edit these two files with [Google Translator Toolkit](https://translate.google.com/toolkit/list?hl=pt_BR#translations/active)
4. After you finish your editions, you can send us the file as a proposal in [one of the many translation requests we created](https://wantoid.com/search?query=wantoid) or as a [suggestion](https://wantoid.com/ticket/edit/)
