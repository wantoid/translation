# Translation

## Not a technical user?

Contact us to help and we'll explain in details everything you need. Either find [one of the many translation requests we created](https://wantoid.com/search?query=wantoid) and post a proposal or [talk to us directly](https://wantoid.com/ticket/edit/).

## How to translate

1. Choose the language you want to contribute to (e.g. /it_IT). If you don't find it, not a problem, you can copy the files from one of the other existing translations.
2. Inside the folder you'll find two files you should download: `app.po` and `main.po`
3. You can edit these two files with [Google Translator Toolkit](https://translate.google.com/toolkit/list?hl=pt_BR#translations/active), [POEditor](https://poeditor.com/) or any software that translates .PO files.
4. After you finish your editions, you can send us the file as a pull request, or just share it with us in Google Translate.
